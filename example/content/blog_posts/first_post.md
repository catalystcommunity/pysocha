This should be our first post.  I could technically generate this or manipulate it after the fact, or use part of it, or mix it up <b>with HTML</b> if I want.

Really anything I want, as complex as I want that fits into markdown. Who knows, maybe I'll add some scripting component or something if I need something fancier later, but today is not that day.
